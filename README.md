## Differences with the original version<br>
- Handles work with a push mechanism (didn't have the pieces to make it work like the original)<br>
- Table height is a bit bigger by 4 rows<br>
- Added second pair of legs because the original ones kept breaking<br>
- Need 2 small elastics for the flippers<br>
<br>
Everything else is more less the same :) <br>
